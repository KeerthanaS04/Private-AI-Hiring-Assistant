First, Clone this project
                     ||
                    \  /
                     \/
Run the jupyter_notebooks/gemma_unsloth.ipynb
                     ||
                    \  /
                     \/
Save the model locally. There's a GPU requirement here also, so I used ngrok
                     ||
                    \  /
                     \/
Run the gemma.ipynb. You will get a link finally, copy the link and paste it in gemma_runner.py
                     ||
                    \  /
                     \/
Now, you can run the streamlit main.py
